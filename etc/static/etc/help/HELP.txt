1) General description
-----------------------

MEGARA ETC is an exposure time calculator for the MEGARA instrument
(Multi-Espectrografo en GTC de Alta Resolucion para Astronomia) at the GTC
10m-telescope. This tool is intended to simulate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)
for a given exposure time for GTC/MEGARA. 

Given a set of input parameters defining the continuum flux distribution of the
input source, MEGARA ETC provides the SNR expected for a given exposure time,
instrument configuration, night atmospheric conditions, and  observational
setup. In case that the properties of a line in the source spectrum are also
provided, MEGARA ETC also computes its expected SNR. 

Once you have selected a certain combination of input parameters, click the
"Compute" button to start the computation. The input parameters will be updated
in the "Input parameters" output window, and the resulting SNRs will appear in
the "Continuum output S/N" and "Line output S/N" windows on the right of the
MEGARA ETC, for the selected continuum and the line input parameters
respectively.

Outputs can be written/appended to an output file (megaraetc.out), located in
the present directory, just clicking on the "Print to file" button.

For more information, click on the "Help" button of the MEGARA ETC, or read the
"Exposure Time Calculator for GTC/MEGARA - Users manual" <web-link TBD>

To quit, press the "Quit" button or just press "q".

** Important remark **

Notice that this tool provides the modelled SNRs for a given exposure time
without accounting for instrument and telescope overheads. This means that you
must add the typical overheads to the exposure time estimated by the MEGARA ETC
for obtaining your required SNR (typical overheads ~ 20-30% of the total
exposure time).

transm. + spectrograph transm. (optics + VPHs + detector QE).

2) Description of input parameters
-----------------------------------


* Target Input Flux Distribution 

This set of parameters is intended to describe the flux distribution of the
source to observe. 

    1) Source Type:

If the source is point or extended. If point source is chosen, the target
object is assumed to be an emitter with negligible angular size. This can be
selected for objects with an angular radius of much less than the sky-projected
pixel size. If extended source is chosen, the target object is assumed to have
a uniform intensity along its whole apparent area. If "Source type=extended",
then the input parameter "Size" becomes mandatory.

    2) Size:

For extended sources, apparent projected area of source in arcsec**2. Circular
shape is assumed for the source. This parameter is available only if the
'Source Type=Extended' option is set.

    3) Input flux:

Kind of data inserted to get the signal-to-noise. If "Input flux=Continuum",
only input data necessary to define the continuum of the source are required
for computation. If "Input flux=Line+Continuum", the following input parameters
become mandatory too: "Resolved line", "Line flux", "Line wavelength", "Line
aperture", and "Continuum aperture".

    4) Resolved line:

This parameter indicates if the line can or not be resolved, and it is relevant
only if "Input flux=Line+Continuum". If the line is resolved, the user must
insert the line full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM). Otherwise, the FWHM of the
line is determined by the selected VPH.

    5) Input spectrum

The target model can be defined by the target's spectral type. It uses a
template spectrum, which is scaled to the provided magnitude and filter. The
spectral type is used to make the color correction. ** NOT ACTIVE OPTION YET **

    6) Continuum band:

Band in which the input continuum magnitude or flux is provided. The input
template spectrum is scaled to the input magnitude in this band.

    7) Continuum magnitude:

For point sources, Vega apparent magnitude of the source continuum in the
selected continuum band. For extended sources, the magnitude must be provided
per arcsec**2 in the selected band. Only available if 'Continuum flux' option
is not set.

    8) Continuum flux:

For point sources, flux of source continuum in c.g.s. unit system
(erg/s/cm**2/AA) in the selected continuum band. For extended sources, this
flux is provided per arcsec**2. Only available if the 'Continuum Magnitude'
option is not set.
      
    9) Line flux:

For point sources, flux of line in c.g.s. unit system (erg/s/cm**2). For
extended sources, this flux must be provided per arcsec**2. This parameter is
available only if the 'Input flux=Continuum+Line' option is set.

    10) Line wavelength:

Line wavelength in Angstrom. This parameter is available only if the 'Input
flux=Continuum+Line' option is set.

    11) Line FWHM:

Line FWHM in Angstrom. If the line is not resolved, the nominal FWHM of the
selected VPH at its central wavelength is assumed. This parameter is available
only if the 'Input flux=Continuum+Line' and 'Resolved line=yes' options are
set.


* Instrumental setup

   1) MEGARA observing mode:

  Select the observing mode that you are going to use (LCB: Large Compact
  Bundle, or MOS: Multi-Object Spectrograph). This basically sets the radius of
  fibers and the achieved spectral resolution. 

  Both, LCB and the MOS modes, use fibers of 0.620 arcsec (100 microns
  diameter), providing spectral resolutions of 6000, 12000, and 18700 in
  low-, medium-, and high-resolution VPHs in a diameter enclosing 80% of
  energy, respectively. 

    2) VPH setup:

Consult the characteristics of each spectral setup in the table accesible
through the help button (labeled as '?') placed next to the 'VPH setup'. The
wavelength of the input spectral line must be located into the wavelength range
of the selected VPH. A program warning is shown if this is the case and no
computation will be performed.


* Atmosphere

    1) Moon phase:

The following options for the night brightness are available: dark/grey/bright.
The sky magnitude at a dark night in La Palma is initially set in the
photometric band nearest to the user-selected VPH (consult Table 2). The
typical average extra brightness between a dark and grey or bright night is
added, depending on the user-selected moon phase (consult Table 3), assuming
that the difference of emission between dark-bright and dark-grey does not
depend on the optical band. The average emission due to zodiacal light,
airglow, and starlight are also considered. Atmospheric extinction will be
considered in next versions.

Table 2: Near-zenith dark-of-moon broad-band sky brightness 
at La Palma for different bands in mag/arcsec**2 
(C.R.Benn & S.L. Ellison 1997, La Palma technical note 115.)
-------------------------------
# Band # Magnitude/arcsec**2 (*1)
-------------------------------
U  22.0
B  22.7
V  21.9
R  21.0
I  20.0
-------------------------------
(*1) Values found to be independent of atmospheric extinction, 
usually do not vary appreciably during the night, but with solar 
cycle, latitude and airmass


Table 3: Extra magnitudes to be added to reference values of sky emission in
Table 2, for bright, grey, and dark nights in La Palma, in mag/arcsec**2 in the
V-band, in order to account for zodiacal light, airglow, and starlight (I.
Skillen, 2002, ING Technical Note 127)
--------------------------------------------------
# Moon phase  # Extra emission in mag/arcsec**2
--------------------------------------------------
Bright  3.1
Grey    1.5
Dark    0.5
--------------------------------------------------

    2) Airmass

Airmass scales the number of photons from the sky background with according to
the following expression: (-0.000278719*X**3 - 0.0653841*X**2 + 1.11979*X -
0.0552132).


    3) Seeing at Airmass

Seeing in arcsec. The value refers to the FWHM of the seeing disk in V band, at
the previously indicated airmass X. For illustration purposes, the seeing at
airmass = 1.0 (zenith) is also computed, assuming that it scales with the
airmass X as follows: Seeing(Zenith) = Seeing(X) / X**3/5. Both seeing values
are written to the "Input parameters" output window of the "Results" menu.


* Observational Setup

    1) Exptime:

Total exposure time in seconds. This exposure time does not take into account
instrument and telescope overheads or the dithering required to ensure total
coverage of the target (see ** Important remark **, in section 1) of this
help).

    2) No. of sky mini-bundles:

Number of sky mini-bundles used to derive the sky spectrum to subtract. The
maximum no. is 100. Each sky bundle consists on 7 fibres in a compact
distribution (lenslets appended to fibers are hexagonal). 

    3) Line aperture:

Aperture to derive line flux in spectrum, in line FWHM units. This parameter is
available only if the 'Input flux=Continuum+Line' option is set.

    4) Continuum aperture:

Aperture to estimate continuum around the line for continuum-subtraction, in
line FWHM units. This parameter is available only if the 'Input
flux=Continuum+Line' option is set.

---------------------------------
3) Description of output windows
---------------------------------

    * Input parameters:

A summary of the selected input parameters is provided here, with some warnings
and extra information about the input source flux distribution.

    * Continuum output S/N:

The SNRs of the continuum input flux distribution expected for the input
observational and instrumental setup, and for the input atmospheric conditions
are provided. 

In case the input source is punctual, the provided SNRs are for:
 - the total source area(*1), in 4 spectral pixels(*2), in 1 Angstrom, in the
   total collapsed spectrum (spaxel);
 - in one fibre, in 4 spectral pixels(*2), in 1 Angstrom, in the total
   collapsed spectrum (spaxel);
 - per detector pixel.

Notice that the SNR in one fibre, considering 4 spectral pixels is, by
definition, a SPAXEL(*2), i.e., the minimum spatial and spectral resolution
element of the observation.

In case of extended sources, the following outputs are additionally provided:
 - for 1 seeing disk, in 4 spectral pixels(*2), in 1 Angstrom, in the total
   collapsed spectrum (spaxel);
 - for 1 arcsec**2,  in 4 spectral pixels(*2), in 1 Angstrom, in the total
   collapsed spectrum (spaxel).

 Note: (*1) The number of fibres required to sample the whole source is also
            provided.

       (*2) At least, 4 spectral pixels are required to fulfill the
            Nyquist-Shanon sampling theorem in spectral direction. By
            construction, MEGARA always projects the VPH FWHM of any selected
            VPH onto 4 pixels in the spectral direction of the detector.

    * Continuum line S/N:

The SNRs of the line input flux distribution expected for the input
observational and instrumental setup, and for the input atmospheric conditions
are provided. 

In case the input source is punctual, the provided SNRs are for(*3):
 - the total source area, in the selected line spectral aperture(*4);
 - per arcsec and per Angstrom in the detector(*5);
 - in one fibre, in the selected line spectral aperture(*4);
 - in one fibre, per Angstrom(*5);
 - per voxel(*6,*7);
 - per detector pixel(*8).

In case of extended sources, the following outputs are additionally provided:  
 - for 1 seeing disk, in the selected line spectral aperture(*4); 
 - for 1 arcsec**2,  in the selected line spectral aperture(*4).

 Note: (*3) Considering that all the line flux is completely enclosed into the
            FWHM of the line.
       (*4) Assuming the selected spectral apertures for line and continuum
            subtraction indicated as inputs. If you want to know exactly the
            SNR in 1 line FWHM, set the spectral apertures of line to 1 (i.e.,
            to one line FWHM). 
       (*5) Assuming a spectral aperture of 1 Angstrom.
       (*6) Assuming 4 spectral pixels as spectral aperture (i.e., the FWHM of
            the selected VPH).
       (*7) A voxel is the minimum spatial and spectral resolution element
            sampled. In our case, a voxel is the projection of the whole fibre
            (minimum spatial resolution element) into the FWHM of the VPH in
            the spectral direction (minimum spectral resolution element
            according to the Nyquist-Shanon sampling theorem). The FWHM of all
            VPHs in MEGARA is projected onto 4 spectral pixels by design.
       (*8) Assuming 1 spectral pixel as spectral aperture.
