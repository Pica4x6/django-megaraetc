** NUMBER OF SKY BUNDLES **
Number of sky mini-bundles used (max. = 100).
Each minibundle has 7 fibres.
The bundles of 8 robotic actuators, located at the corners
of the MOS FoV, are used to measure the sky in the LCB observing mode.
They are projected at different positions along the pseudo-slit
to estimate projection effects and different transmissions of instrument depending on the spectrum position in the
detector.
